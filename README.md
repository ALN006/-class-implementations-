this is is a folder of my first class implementations. The only file of interest here is piAproximator. 
piaproximator is a python implementation of a class block + a function to simulate the pi collisions between 2 blocks and a wall, a problem popularized by 3B1B
+ a bunch of graphs of the scenario to help me understand it better.

warning: this was entirely an exercise of learning, this code has not been properly tested, it is documented minimally.
